Difference between SOAP and REST


SOAP:

-Simple Object Access Protocol
-it is a protocol
-It cannot make use of REST since it is a protocol
-It uses service interface to expose its functionality
 to client applications, ex: WSDL
-it require more bandwidth, since it contains lot of info.(amt of
 data transfer is lot)
-it can only work with XML format



REST:
-Representational State Transfer
-it is an architecture pattern
-it can make use of a SOAP as the underlying protocol of webservices
-it uses uniform service locators to access components of HW device 
 (can access URL)
-it doesnt require much bandwidth, it is light weight
-it can work with multiple formats(JSON, xml,html, plain text, etc)
